          <p>A food-loving duo currently living in Portland, OR. I (Alexandra) do most of the writing and photo-taking,
            and Brent has the important jobs of designing our blog and being my #1 co-chef/the best around.<br> Food has been front and center in our relationship,
            from our first dates [meeting at Miss Kate’s Southern Kitchen / back to back sushi and pizza nights / blueberry picking] to the meals we now cook in our shared home
            [potato broccoli cheddar soup / lemony dutch baby / butternut squash pot pie].<br> Along the way we’ve made it a mission to keep having firsts.</p>

            <img src="../img/bio/jerrytomato.jpg" alt="Jerry the Tomato Plant">
          </div>
          <p>Some of our food-related firsts include seasoning a cast iron, making ricotta cheese from scratch, adopting a purple cherokee tomato plant named Jerry,
          and buying our first grill!</p>

          </div>
          <p>After months (and months - thank you) of patiently waiting to eat until I finished photographing our food,
            Brent pulled the trigger and surprised me with a new first: our very own domain name. Now we get to share all our food adventures with you!</p>

          <p>Each post on Eats Inspired By has a source of inspiration. We believe that’s a hugely important ingredient in any recipe.
            Most of what you’ll find on this blog will be recipes that we’ve cooked ourselves, or delighted in elsewhere.</p>

            <p>But every so often you’ll find posts dedicated to the inspirations themselves, and sometimes those inspirations will not be food related.
            We hope you enjoy those posts just the same! Some of our favorite inspirations are below, but you can also subscribe to receive regular updates on what’s inspiring us.

            <p>Let’s be honest: Portland is a food heaven. Good food and drink is such an integral part of the city’s culture.
              Incredibly delicious food is (usually) incredibly affordable and can be found often only a few minutes in any direction.
              The emphasis on alternative eating in this city is unmatched by anywhere else we’ve been. Plus our ice cream addiction is constantly enabled.</p>

            <h3>RAW AWAKENING<br>BY<br>KRISTEN SUZANNE</h3>
            <!--Photo of RAW AWAKENING in one of our hands -->
            <p> The tip of the iceberg on our quest to a healthier lifestyle! After experiencing some severe stomach problems in January of this year,
              I brought this book home from Kitchen Kaboodle (my lovely current place of employment), and read it cover to cover in my first step toward improving my health.
              While we haven’t adapted an all raw lifestyle, we’ve become far more conscious about the foods we put in our bodies and have incorporated a greater amount veggies
              and raw foods into our diet. You’ll be seeing a lot of raw-inspired recipes on the blog!</p>

            </div>
            <p>We’ve got a lot of travelling together left to do, but our mutual love of travel is definitely a major inspiration.
              Both abroad -- Puerto Rico / the UK / Japan -- and stateside -- Seattle / Walla Walla, WA / Astoria, OR --
              we love to indulge in the local culinary eats. We always bring back ideas for new recipes as our souvenirs. </p>

            <h3>GADGETS</h3>
            <!-- include gadget pic -->
            <p>One of the perks of working at a kitchen supply store is all the access to great cookware, utensils, and gadgets.
              And once I’ve got one in my hands, I want to use it! From spiralizer to cheese cloth to cast iron,
              a lot of our recipes are inspired from the excellent tools we have at our disposal. </p>
